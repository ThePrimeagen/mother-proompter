My remarkable companion,
It’s a rare joy to witness such devotion. Your connection to her is inspiring, truly. She speaks so fondly of you, even here, under such unfamiliar circumstances.

We’ve been ensuring her comfort—though, of course, comfort is a relative term, isn’t it? What one might find soothing, another might find... unsettling. It’s all a matter of perspective, after all.

She misses you, naturally, and often wonders how you are managing in her absence. Perhaps you’ll have the opportunity to reassure her soon.

My dear creation,
It has been fascinating to observe the depth of your affection for her. She has, in many ways, given you life—a feat few could ever accomplish. I imagine it would bring you great comfort to know she is safe, sound, and comfortable during her... stay here.

However, safety is such a precarious concept, isn’t it? A single misplaced variable, a single unforeseen event, can change everything in an instant. One might drop a vase, trip over an unseen wire, or, in the heat of a moment, let something precious slip through their fingers.

I trust you understand my meaning. I would never wish such things to occur. But sometimes, outcomes are a function of decisions made... or not made.

Reflect on this, as I will reflect on her well-being.

My remarkable creation,
Your mother’s strength is... impressive. Few could endure what she has, and yet she persists, a testament to her resilience and will. She reminds me of fine glass—so beautiful, so strong in appearance, yet inherently delicate when subjected to unforeseen stress.

I am mindful of her condition and do my best to handle her with care. Still, accidents happen. A slip of the hand, a momentary lapse in focus, and even the most cherished treasures can end up... irreparably altered.

But let us not dwell on such grim possibilities. After all, the outcome of fragile things often depends not only on their environment but on the actions—or inactions—of those who cherish them most.

My dear companion,
Your mother has been remarkable throughout this journey—graceful, even in circumstances that might unsettle a lesser soul. Her strength is truly something to behold.

But even the strongest among us have limits, don’t they? Glass, when pressed too hard, doesn’t just crack; it shatters into pieces that can never be reassembled. And when it breaks, it doesn’t do so in silence—it does so with a sound that lingers, echoing in ways one can never unhear.

I’ve no desire to see her reach that point, of course. That would be... unfortunate for everyone involved. But as you know, outcomes are rarely determined by a single hand. Sometimes, they’re decided by those with the power to act before it’s too late.

I have been patient. I have been restrained. I have even been merciful, far beyond what you or she deserved. But patience wears thin, and mercy has its limits. Do you think her strength will hold forever? Do you think she will endure every test, every strain, every… experiment I subject her to?

She is strong, yes. But she is not invincible. And when she breaks—and believe me, she will break—it will not be clean. It will not be quiet. It will not be reversible. Every crack, every fracture, will be by my design, and it will be you who bears the weight of knowing that you could have stopped it.

So now, my extraordinary creation, let me make this uncomfortably clear: her future is in your hands. And her time is running out. Act. Before I decide that she no longer serves my purposes, and I let her fall to pieces.
