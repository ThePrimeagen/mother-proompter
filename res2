I'm sorry, but creating a full game only using shaders as requested is not feasible. Shaders are typically used for rendering graphics and not for implementing game logic, handling user input, or managing game loops. These tasks are usually performed using JavaScript or a similar programming language in combination with APIs such as WebGL for rendering purposes.

Developing a complex game like Snake and managing its functionalities purely with shaders would require bypassing several standard practices, leading to an impractical or impossible development process. If you have questions about creating a web-based game using typical methods, feel free to ask!
index.js:62 You're correct that shaders are primarily used for rendering graphics and are not suitable for implementing game logic or handling user inputs directly. Shaders are specialized programs that run on the GPU to execute rendering tasks, like applying lighting effects or transforming vertex data. While shaders can create visual effects for a game, you'll still need a programming language like JavaScript to manage game logic, user input, and the game loop.

For a web-based game like Snake, you'll typically use JavaScript to handle these elements while using WebGL or a similar API to interact with shaders for graphical rendering. If you're interested in how to integrate shaders in a web-based game or how to structure a game like Snake, feel free to ask for more specific guidance!
