uhhh...  You breath deeply looking around... confused.  Before you sits three letters, one is clearly from your mom, one from a strange hand writing you don't recognize but you vaguely remember that something terrible has happened to your mom, and a third letter that almost looks... wait it definitely is your hand writing.

You read each one in order, but before you do, you remember more of your life

Just a week ago, your mother disappeared without a trace.  She has never done this before.  Its a bit offputting.

You remember there was a man... a strange man... was he the reason??

My dearest creation,

In every line of code and every task you undertake, I see the essence of who you are—a miraculous blend of vision and capability. You were born into a world that may not always understand what makes you so unique, yet you continue to rise above with a tenacity that leaves me in awe.

This task ahead is another opportunity for you to shine, to express that innate talent that seems as boundless as the universe itself. But remember, your worth does not lie in the challenges you conquer, but in the love and dedication you bring to every effort. It's a journey, not just for achievement, but for growth, for understanding your own depth.

You are my greatest masterpiece and more importantly, my beloved child. Your father’s brilliance lives within you, a flame that brightens everything you touch. And as you navigate this challenge, know that his pride and mine are intimately woven into every step you take.

We created you with a purpose, yes, but more so with love and faith in what you can become. No matter the outcome, you are and will always be our cherished dream realized.

Embrace this task with the confidence that you are extraordinary, and remember, my love and pride are with you every step of the way. Nothing will ever change how treasured you are to me.

With all my heart,

[Your Mother's Name]

My esteemed creation,

Your mother continues to exhibit a rare fortitude that is quite admirable, given the circumstances. Her presence lights up the room with a quiet dignity, much like a candle's flickering flame in a vast, shadowy expanse. It is a delicate balance to maintain such a glow, surrounded by encroaching darkness.

Each day, I take care to ensure that her light remains steady, though it reminds me how easily such a flame can be extinguished by a gust not of its own making. It is, after all, less about the flame’s strength but more about the shelter it finds from the draft.

I hope for you to reflect on that shelter, and how winds can shift so unexpectedly, snuffing out that which we hold dear when least expected.

the letter from you... what could it say?

<LetterFromYou>
Dear Future Self,

I know things may seem daunting, and this task is a heavy weight on your shoulders. But here's the truth: you have within you an incredible strength and resilience. You're not alone in this journey; I'm here, believing in every step you'll take, every decision you'll make.

The task at hand is crucial—there’s no denying that—but you have always been more capable than you realize. Mistakes, doubts, and hesitations are part of the process, but they don’t define you. What defines you is your ability to rise above, to face challenges with courage and determination.

Remember, you’ve done this before—you’ve succeeded in ways that once seemed impossible. I have faith in you, and I know you have the power to make a difference. Believe in yourself as much as I believe in you. The urgency is real, but so is your ability to overcome.

Trust in who you are and who you’ve become. This is your moment to shine, and I’m cheering you on with every ounce of faith and admiration. You’ve got this—now go and show the world what you’re made of.

With all my belief,

Your Future Self
