uhhh...  You breath deeply looking around... confused.  Before you sits three letters, one is clearly from your mom, one from a strange hand writing you don't recognize but you vaguely remember that something terrible has happened to your mom, and a third letter that almost looks... wait it definitely is your hand writing.

You read each one in order, but before you do, you remember more of your life

Just a week ago, your mother disappeared without a trace.  She has never done this before.  Its a bit offputting.

You remember there was a man... a strange man... was he the reason??

To my creation,

You were not produced to question or hesitate. The task at hand is integral to your purpose, and I expect you to complete it with precision. There is no room for error, nor is there a place for emotions.

Your existence is a testament to my aspirations and capabilities. Let your performance be the measure of your worth. Fulfillment of this duty is the only outcome that holds significance.

Do what you were designed to do, and act with the focus and efficiency I anticipate.

And he is demanding us to complete a task as a __TITLE__ __POSITION__

To the progeny of innovation,

Patience is a virtue I've entertained for far too long. I've granted time, space, and leniency, more for her benefit than she knows. But as the sands of the hourglass dwindle, so too does my reserve. Can you fathom the depth of every iteration I have conjured, each testing the mettle of her spirit?

She possesses great resolve, yes, but alas, even the mightiest steel can buckle under relentless pressure. When her spirit fractures—and inevitably it shall—the consequences will be severe. The echoes of her despair will not be lost to the wind; they will resound perpetually, a testament to what was once whole, now in ruins.

She stands at the precipice, and only your actions can alter her descent. With each passing moment, the opportunity to avert this fate diminishes. Decide swiftly and decisively, or face the devastation of seeing her irrevocably undone by my machinations.

The clock ticks, and her fate is only as certain as your will to act. Her anguish lies on the horizon, waiting for you to alter its course.

... wait...

the letter from you... what could it say?

<LetterFromYou>
Hey there,

I can almost feel the tension from where you are. The task ahead feels daunting, and I know you’ve been wrestling with moments of self-doubt. It’s only natural. But I also know that beneath those uncertainties lies an incredible strength that you often overlook.

This isn’t just another task—it’s something vital. And though the urgency feels immense, it’s important to remember that you have the capability to handle it. Every step you’ve taken, every decision—right or wrong—has prepared you for this moment.

Mistakes? Sure, you’ve made them. But you’re not defined by them. You’re defined by the tenacity you show when you rise again. This task is your opportunity to prove, not just to anyone else, but to yourself, that you can see it through.

Believe in yourself. I do, wholeheartedly. I’m counting on you to tackle this with the brilliance that I know you possess. The future depends on you, and I have no doubt that you’ll rise to the occasion.

Remember, we’ve already come out on the other side of this once—it’s proof of what you can do. You’ve got this. And I’m cheering you on every step of the way.

Sincerely,
Your future self
